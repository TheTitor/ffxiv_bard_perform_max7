Max 7 Patch to convert a Midi KB to the FFXIV Bard Instrument settings. Will automatically go up and down octaves by converting the Midi input to keystrokes with their modifiers. 

Requires the autobot mxj dependency, which converts the midi to keystrokes

-Warning- The shift/control modifiers will not reset automatically, which might result in weird behavior. If you are playing up an octave, it will continue to hold the modifier key until you press a non modified note (one that doesn't need shifted up or down in the scale). This includes if you stop playing, your computer might still think you are holding a modifier key until you press the non modified octave.
